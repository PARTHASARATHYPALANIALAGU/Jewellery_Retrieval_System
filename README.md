# ✨ Jewellery Retrieval System

A sophisticated, AI-powered jewellery search engine that allows users to find their favorite pieces using multiple search modalities: text, images, sketches, and voice.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔍 Multi-Modal Search**: Find jewellery using any of the following methods:
  - **Natural Language**: Search using descriptive text (e.g., "Golden ring with diamond").
  - **Image Search**: Upload a photo to find similar-looking jewellery.
  - **Sketch Search**: Draw a rough sketch and let the AI find matching pieces.
  - **OCR Search**: Upload an image containing text to extract and search for products.
  - **Voice Search**: Search by simply speaking your query.
- **🖼️ Visual Intelligence**: Powered by OpenAI's **CLIP** model for deep visual understanding.
- **⚡ High-Performance Retrieval**: Uses **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for lightning-fast indexing and searching.
- **🎨 Premium UI**: A luxurious "Midnight Gold" themed interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.
